Here are some questions I need to anwser :

When IPv4 is used, does the application use techniques to traverse NATs ?
What addresses are packets sent to ? Find out which names domain they match, do you observe a particular trend in the family address? Can you explain it ?

Can you anwser to those with the following informations ?

Notes :
	IP addresses beginning with 10 or 192.168 : These addresses are in use by many millions of independently operated networks, which might be as small as a single computer connected to a home gateway, and are automatically configured in hundreds of millions of devices. They are only intended for use within a private context  and traffic that needs to cross the Internet will need to use a different, unique address.
	IP addresses beginning with 127 : These addresses are used when one program needs to talk to another program running on the same machine using the Internet.





Here are some traces, for each one of these, you can find the IPv4 and IPv6 sources and destinations with the percentage of packets sent to them or sent by them.
